This repository is part of the work presented in [High-performance parallel implementations of flow accumulation algorithms for multicore architectures](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2021.104741).

It contains the results and source code used in this study. Although the project is still under development, the purpose of this repository is to present the algorithms used in the measurements, therefore the source code available here will not be updated.
